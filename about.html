        <h3 id="about-headline">Tired of buying hair products?</h3>
        <p class="about-graf introduction">If you have curly hair, you’ve probably heard about Devachan founder Lorraine Massey’s Curly Girl Method (CGM), which advises against using products that include sulfates, parabens, silicones, and alcohol. (Check out her book, <i><a class="flexed-links" href="https://www.amazon.com/Curly-Girl-Handbook-Michele-Bender/dp/076115678X">Curly Girl: The Handbook</a></i>.) The CGM clearly lays out what to avoid: shampoo, heat styling tools, combs and brushes, and products with ingredients that dry out your hair. With all the  method’s rules, though, it can be hard to figure out which products you <i>should</i> use. What a Curl Wants is a website dedicated to helping you determine which hair masks, styling products, and leave-in conditioners will have the best effect on your unique curls.</p> 

        <p class="about-graf introduction">This site focuses on three main categories: <span class="special">porosity</span>, <span class="special">density</span>, and <span class="special">protein</span>. <span class="extra">Porosity</span> plays a big part in how well your curls become and remain hydrated. Without properly moisturized curls, your hair will be more prone to frizz and have difficulty retaining its curl. Low-porosity and high-porosity hair types have different needs. In order to pick the right products for your hair, it's crucial that you understand your hair's porosity. There are three levels of porosity: low, medium (or normal), and high. Typically, those with very high or very low porosity have problems. Low-porosity hair has difficulty opening up the cuticle to receive moisture from water and conditioning agents. However, because the hair shaft so readily closes, low-porosity hair has no issues retaining moisture once it gets it. High porosity hair has the opposite problem. Because the hair shaft is more open, it has more difficulty closing when drying so any moisture that makes it in also escapes very easily.</p>

        <p class="about-graf introduction">Knowing your <span class="extra">density</span>, or the amount of hair you have on your head, can help you determine whether you need volumizing products. Those with very dense hair might also want to refrain from using heavy products.</p>

        <p class="about-graf introduction">And finally, it’s important to know whether your hair craves <span class="extra">protein</span>. Protein helps you keep your hair hydrated, as it promotes water retention. This increased hydration reduces breakage because hair is less likely to break when it is flexible—and hair is most flexible when it is well hydrated. Ironically, hair with too much protein can feel brittle, stiff, coarse, and rough "like straw.” It loses curl definition and can actually become straight. Having too much protein can also result in more frequent tangles and knots.</p>
